## 📌 Project Overview
Student performance prediction helps educational institutions identify students who may need academic support at an early stage.  
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict student academic performance based on demographic, academic, and behavioral features.

The focus is on building a **complete ML pipeline**, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and comparison.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Understand and analyze student performance data  
✔ Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering  
✔ Train and compare multiple machine learning models  
✔ Evaluate models using appropriate regression metrics  
✔ Build a reusable and modular ML pipeline
